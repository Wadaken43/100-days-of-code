**Today's Progress**: I started "100-days-of-code".Logistic regression and softmax regression implementation. 

**Thoughts:** I want to not only solidify the basics of deep learning, but also develop the skills necessary to become a machine learning engineer while still a student. Get into the habit of moving your hands.

**Today's Progress**: MNIST hand-drawn text data and the fashion version of MNIST (Fashion MNIST, 10 classes) were classified by softmax regression.
Logistic and softmax regression were implemented and trained.

**Thoughts:** 1. realized the importance of actually implementing the functions used in the model by working with my hands (scratch development)
2. in order to improve the accuracy of the model, it is better to keep the learning rate small at first and gradually increase it (warmup)
3. chatgpt is effective for understanding formulas
